# Dear Frosh Project
Dear Frosh is a series of letters collected from [University of Toronto Engineering](https://www.engineering.utoronto.ca) students addressed to their first year selves.

This initiative is created and facilitated by the [1% Inspiration Podcast](https://www.engineering.utoronto.ca), a U of T engineering based podcast about making the most of an engineering (and undergraduate) education. It is inspired by the original ["Dear Penn Freshmen"](https://dearpennfresh.com) launched at the University of Pennsylvania in 2015 by Lauren McCann.
