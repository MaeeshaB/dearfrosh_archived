                        <br>
                        <p>Dear Future Engineer,</p>
                        <p>Hey there, welcome to UofT Engineering! I’m Cece an Indy 2T1+1+ Pey. Really weird experience,
                            I was in indy then went to ECE for second year then came back to indy…will say I have
                            absolutely no regrets and would do it all over again. I’ll be graduating this year and
                            thought it would be great to share some parts of my memories here.
                            <br><br>
                            Looking back, first year was such a long time ago! I had no idea that the years would just
                            fly right by me. Here I met friends that stayed by my side and changed the course of my life
                            for the better. People that showed me new experiences from cafes, graffiti art, 10 course
                            tasting menus, wine tastings, the Toronto startup community, skydiving and that’s just the
                            start of the list!
                            <br><br>
                            Initially, I really didn’t know what I signed up for. To be fair I flipped a coin right
                            before the OUAC website crashed. It was either engineering or actuarial science and well
                            that’s how I ended up here. One question that everyone will ask you (and I guarantee you
                            this) is “Where do you want to be?” Honestly, it’s a really hard question to answer when you
                            haven’t explored the world. It’s crazy to think that you would have your life set out by the
                            age of 17. In grade 12 I would spend my days sitting by the harbourfront listening to emo
                            music and sipping bubble tea. Yeah I had that phase.
                            <br><br>
                            I was just so lost when I came into first year. I didn’t know what I wanted or what’s even
                            out there. I felt out of place, everyone here was smart and high achieving. Some people
                            seemed to have it all figured out, doing crazy stuff in highschool and I was just here going
                            with the flow. I actually felt bad for being in indy. I didn’t have a great sense of the
                            careers I could take on and if they would be any good for me. To be honest, ever since I was
                            7 I wanted to walk on to Bay Street in a suit, because I saw a woman do that. Really that
                            was all the aim I had. I will say though, I have been doing that on my PEY :)
                            <br><br>
                            This is why I had the weird switch between the programs. As a first year I wish I was more
                            comfortable with the idea of not knowing where I’d end up and just continued learning as
                            much as I can outside of the class. Here is the first piece of advice I can offer you. Your
                            engineering program doesn’t explicitly define which careers you end up in, it’s how you use
                            those skills you learn and where you apply them. You might find yourself stuck between two
                            programs. I’d say go with your guts and build up a solid resume with things outside of
                            school.
                            <br><br>
                            You might also be trying to figure out what you like and who you’d like to be. Getting
                            involved in outside extracurriculars is a great way to start. Even if you don’t know your
                            interests, that is ok. Show up to that club you know nothing about! The only way to find out
                            where you want to go, is to actually try as much as possible. Uni is like a chance for you
                            to carve out who you want to be and aim at it. I’m actually surprised by how things work out
                            if you are persistent. I almost dropped out of engineering because A LOT of my life was
                            falling apart.
                            <br><br>
                            It was a pretty anxious time and family obligations were overwhelming me. Sometimes, it did
                            feel like this place wasn’t for me. Actually my 2nd year of indy was the tipping point, when
                            I got sick during exam season and had to defer 2 courses to the winter semester. During my
                            winter semester I managed 8 courses, and clubs to stack my resume. Oftentimes I worked past
                            midnight pulling late nights to manage everything. It was a lot to take on. The fall of
                            second year indy put me on probation and if I didn’t get my act together in the winter, I
                            would have to leave school for a year. It really felt like I was being pushed to an edge but
                            some of the people in my life carried me through that time and that includes faculty.
                            <br><br>
                            I even went as far planning out and asking my academic advisor about transferring out after
                            2nd year Indy. I didn’t actually know if I’d land a PEY position but I sat in shock when I
                            got a call back saying I got the job I wanted. Well sort of….I was looking to be a
                            quantitative trader but was offered an AI engineering position at the bank. Even during that
                            call I didn’t know if I was a good fit. I didn’t realize it back then but, this is where I
                            learned to make pivots and take new opportunities. More importantly, be comfortable being
                            uncomfortable. It’s an important skill because it helps open new paths, take on more
                            challenging work and build your skill sets faster. My PEY wasn’t what I expected at the
                            start but I couldn’t have asked for anything better. Most of the opportunities I got was
                            because I put my hand up and was willing to do things I had zero experience in. During my
                            PEY I built AI models, did human centred design, product management, execution strategy,
                            quantitative trading and even learned a lot about crypto!
                            <br><br>
                            What I really want you to get out of this is that, whatever comes your way, work hard and be
                            very good at what you are given. If things start to go south, remember what you’d like to do
                            and do everything possible to make small steps in that direction. On nights like that, I
                            really like to look at the moon at Harbourfront. Why? Because the moon lets the clouds pass
                            by and still looks beautiful. So do that with your thoughts during tough times too. Be
                            persistent and opportunities open up.
                            <br><br>
                            Speaking of opportunities, I genuinely believe you’re boundless here…haha you’ll get that
                            reference soon. However, new opportunities meant pushing my limits and trying new things but
                            this time I don’t mean academics or work. PEY actually gave me the chance to focus more on
                            my personal life and self-reflect. I don’t think this is emphasised enough but you go to
                            university to learn how to think and challenge what you know so far, not just in the
                            classroom but outside. This includes your values, world views, global events and having a
                            desire to learn how the world works. Tend to that sense of curiosity because it changes what
                            you value and what value you want to add in your future. I found that reading philosophy,
                            painting, art and poetry helped me reflect on myself. Engineering is lucrative and
                            oftentimes school will be a top priority in your mind, but you’re a person first. A person
                            that can experience emotions, dream, be curious and express themselves. For example, I like
                            strange things. I went skydiving and I love a fancy restaurant where the view is on the 54th
                            floor of a random building. Then, I like to look straight down at tiny people. I ABSOLUTELY
                            LOVE to order dessert first at a restaurant then get my meals backwards and finish with a
                            nice appetizer just to see how the staff react. Would argue that it tastes better. So figure
                            out what you like and remember to actually experience things during your undergrad.
                            <br><br>
                            Lastly, I spent a lot more time with people during my PEY and explored lots of places in the
                            city. It was eye opening to see how those relationships make a difference after a long day
                            working as hard as I can. I learned to appreciate people a lot more, especially because my
                            friends have moved away after university and I miss them. Way back in first year I didn’t
                            realize that someone who would end up being so important to me would be gone after all the
                            memories and I didn’t know what that would feel like. So make sure to step back once in a
                            while to enjoy life, even better if you spend it with others. Appreciating people takes
                            time, effort and patiences but it gave me a lot more memories to look back on. You’d be
                            surprised by the people you meet along the way if you keep your mind open. It’s actually
                            more exciting if things change course and you figure your way out.
                            <br><br>
                            Hope this helps! Remember to live, laugh and love your time here.
