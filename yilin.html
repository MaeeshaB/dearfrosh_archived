                        <p>
                            Welcome to Skule™️ and Toronto! I congratulate you, I respect you, and for the discoveries
                            you’ve yet to make, I envy you. <br> <br>
                            One of the first dinners I had upon moving to Toronto was at a noodle shop off Dundas, with
                            several other dishevelled first-years, we found ourselves at a crowded table. Recognizing
                            our age and the time of year, a waiter asked what we came here to study. <br>
                            “Engineering”, a somewhat nervous, but mostly proud, response.<br>
                            “Ohh…you’re some tough ones, no?”<br>
                            <br><br>
                            Engineering’s reputation always seems to precede it. The retention rate was never something
                            I worried so much about, but certain names were always passed down with a simultaneous mix
                            of unease and respect. Linear algebra. CIV100. Calc 2. The world is as big as you want it to
                            be and that fall, the world was an area four blocks long that stretched from Chestnut St. to
                            Bloor St.
                            <br><br>
                            Engineering is tough. There will be winter days spent from 9:10 am - 6:00 pm in Bahen,
                            missing any glimpse of the sun. Nights spent in still-bustling common rooms, thanking Canton
                            Chilli for being open until 2 am. But it’s also your 20s.<br><br>
                            We are so absorbed in our time here to grow as engineers that sometimes we forget that this
                            is also a wonderful opportunity to grow as people. There is no ring given to this endeavor,
                            but its lessons are retained for much longer. So here’s 26 recommendations for the second
                            part, Skule™️ will do swimmingly at the first. But perhaps you’ll find they’re not two
                            separate goals after all.
                            <br><br>
                            1. Write letters to: people you love/respect. People you won’t see for a long time. <br>
                            2. Go to a rooftop, lie down, and listen to the sounds of the city at night for 30
                            minutes<br>
                            3. At a time when they’re not too busy, get into conversation with any or all of the
                            following: janitors, food truck owners, cafeteria staff, bus drivers<br>
                            4. Create with your hands, nice options in the city: book binding, pottery, calligraphy<br>
                            5. Go to the ROM (free on Tuesdays), choose an object, and imagine each step from its
                            creation it took to get to be in front of you today. Learn that people are not the only ones
                            with stories<br>
                            6. Build your own bookshelf from scratch (maybe just starting with the wood planks is ok.
                            Starting with the tree seems much harder)<br>
                            7. Play a stop sign, a pan is also good<br>
                            8. Learn to make and cook with fermented food. Good prep for potential nuclear winters. and
                            miso is delicious.<br>
                            9. Buy a friend tickets to a new play without telling them what it’s about. Have them do the
                            same for you.<br>
                            10. Put away your phone and have a meal in public by yourself<br>
                            11. Sketch the skyline of Toronto from Trillium Park and mail it to someone abroad<br>
                            12. Take 5 mins and try to always see a bit of the sunset, nice spots on campus: Myhal 6th
                            floor, Bahen 8th floor, Robarts 13th floor, Medical Sciences (glass part) 10th floor<br>
                            13. Check out every library U of T has (44!)<br>
                            14. Build the towers of Isengard<br>
                            15. Visit the AGO (Always free for those < 25), draw one of the pieces in 30 seconds, give
                                it to a friend and have them try to find it.<br>
                                16. Get a map of Toronto*, get a friend to close their eyes and stick a pin in the map.
                                Go there together (*replaceable with: campus, ontario, the world)<br>
                                17. Try different modes of transport to get to campus. Try different routes. Maybe even
                                take a detour around the Great Lakes to have an actually good reason for when you show
                                up past T time.<br>
                                18. Sketch an architectural detail from three buildings in Toronto. Appreciate how
                                complex simplicity can be. <br>
                                19. Sketch a botanical detail from three plants in Toronto. Appreciate how simple
                                complexity can be. <br>
                                20. Inadvertently dye your friend’s ceramic bathtub purple two days after they move in
                                and appreciate their landlord’s reaction as you try to explain “…I’m sure it’ll come out
                                with baking soda!”<br>
                                21. Get a country from random country generator, look up their national dish, and cook
                                it <br>
                                22. Learn what it means to hustle<br>
                                23. Learn to see other people hustle and not feel pressured to do the same when you
                                don’t want to<br>
                                24. Walk barefoot on as many different natural surfaces as possible<br>
                                25. Call your parents more<br>
                                26. Tell the people you love, why you love them <br>
                                <br><br>
                                Over the past year, I’ve gotten into the habit of asking people, sometimes strangers, to
                                give me recommendations, which range from personal to widely applicable. I was recently
                                on a train and started talking to the conductor, a grizzled Swiss man who’d also once
                                studied as an engineer. Over the train’s rails, I couldn’t hear him well, so he wrote me
                                one. After scratching out the first thing he wrote, he handed it back with “this is the
                                most free time you’ll ever have.”
                                <br><br>
                                “Hey thanks, but this is a pretty hard recommendation to do” I joked.
                                <br><br>
                                “Ahh, well, I can write you a little list, but I think you know best what you want to do
                                anyways.”
                                <br><br><br>

                                It’s a tough world out there, but above all else, it’s a beautiful one – take it easy
                                and take care.





                                <p>
                                    Love and peace,
